Spatialite for Debian
---------------------

Spatialite uses the SQLite experimental extension mechanism described in
https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html
to provide spatial extensions to the SQLite database in both WKT and WKB
formats as described by OGC. Note that the SQLite extension support could
be changed in future release, so be warned.
