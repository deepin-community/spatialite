spatialite (4.3.0a-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  SpatiaLite 4.3.x is no longer configured to enable liblwgeom, because the
  spatialite->postgis->gdal->spatialite circular dependency this created
  caused too many issues with transitions to newer releases of GEOS and GDAL.

  Concerns about the circular dependency were raised in #808606 and elsewhere.

spatialite (4.3.0~rc0-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  SpatiaLite 4.3.x is now configured to enable liblwgeom and GCP options.
  This causes an implicit license escalation to GPLv2+ from the initial
  tri-license (MPL/LGPL/GPL).

  Enabling these features is the recommended configuration by upstream.

spatialite (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from this release Spatialite library and Spatialtools have been
  decoupled in two different sources as in upstream kits. Each of them now
  follows its own releasing process and has its own version.

spatialite (3.0.0~beta20110817-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  From this release, powerpc will lack full EPSG initialization.
  .
  This means that spatialite won't support all EPSG projections,
  but only a small subset. The list of supported projections can be
  found in '/usr/share/doc/libspatialite-dev/EPSG.powerpc'.
